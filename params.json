{"name":"Metacritic Scraper","body":"## Metacritic Scraper\r\nA simple-to-use script that scrapes Metacritic for game scores. It is coded in Python, and uses no external libraries save for httplib2. The script can receive input from the console, a text file, or a CSV, and can output to the same formats.\r\n\r\nImprovements shall be made as time goes on, however the author will most likely convert this script into a web application using either Flask, Bottle.py, or Django. \r\n\r\n### Usage\r\nThe four acceptable command-line arguments are shown below:\r\n\r\n```\r\npython main.py -out\r\npython main.py -csv <location of csv file>\r\npython main.py -text <location of text file>\r\npython main.py -help\r\n```\r\n### Input and Output\r\nThe script accepts the following input formats:\r\n\r\n1. A text file containing the names of games and consoles, one on each line, separated by a colon (game:console).\r\n\r\n2. A CSV containing two columns: the first listing the names of games; the second listing the games' respective consoles.\r\n\r\n3. Input into the console (or terminal) in the same form as text file input.\r\n\r\n### Support or Contact\r\nYou can find me on Twitter (@Cyph0n) or on my [blog](http://cyph0n.tumblr.com/).","tagline":"Scrapes game scores from Metacritic.
